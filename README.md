# Personal-Projects

A collection of some of my first-year faculty homework projects. These projects reflect some of the skills I developed during that year


*_C++ Projects_*

Some of the skills I developed while working on this applications are:
1. Data Management & CRUD Operations: Created a dynamic data management system for administrators to add, update, and delete records of dogs. I learned the importance of structured data handling                                              for real-time updates and retrieval in applications.
2. File I/O & Data Persistence: Implemented persistent data storage using text files and utilized C++ iostreams for reading/writing data. Developed custom insertion/extraction operators for                                             streamlined file handling.
3. STL & Algorithms: Replaced custom data structures with STL containers like std::vector, and used STL algorithms (copy_if, count_if) and range-based loops for concise and efficient code.
4. Exception Handling & Validation: Built validation mechanisms and custom exception classes to handle errors in repository operations, input validation, and data processing.
5. GUI Development with Qt: Designed a graphical interface in Qt, employing layouts and QTableView for visualizing data. Integrated user interactions, allowing a seamless interface for adoption                                     processes.
6. UML Design: Created a UML class diagram to document and visualize the architecture, improving project organization and communication.
7. Undo/Redo Functionality: Integrated advanced undo/redo capabilities for core operations using inheritance and polymorphism, enhancing the user experience with error correction.
8. Data Visualization: Implemented visual representations (bar charts/pie charts) with QPainter/QCustomPlot for data insight, broadening my skills in visual data presentation.

* Adoption Application (C++/QT):
    - This application supports two main modes: Admin and User.
    - In Admin mode, administrators can manage the shelter's dog database by adding, updating, or removing dog profiles, each containing details like breed, name, age, and a photo link.
    - In User mode, users can browse available dogs one by one, choose to adopt them (adding them to an adoption list), or skip to the next. Users can filter dogs by breed and age, view their adoption          list, and save it in CSV or HTML format for easy access.

* Deliver Application(C++/QT):
    - Description: An application which simulates the process of package delivering by couriers.
    - The skills involved at Adoption App apply here also.

* Patient Manager Application(C++/QT):
    - Description: An application for the management of patients in a hospital
    - This is another example of the applicability of the knowledge from the other two Apps(Adoption and Deliver).

 *_Python Projects_*

Skills that I developed with the help of this projects:
1. Modular Programming: dividing a program into separate, self-contained modules, each responsible for specific functionality.
2. Test-Driven Development (TDD): The goal is to define desired behavior upfront, implement the code to pass these tests, and iteratively refine the code for correctness, leading to reliable, bug-                                        free code.
3. Design Principles for Modular Programs: These principles include single responsibility, encapsulation, separation of concerns, and cohesion, ensuring each module or function has a specific role.
4. Design Principles for Object-Oriented Programs: Principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction create well-organized, scalable code.
5. Layered Architecture and Inheritance: Layered architecture separates a program into logical layers for better organization.

* Gomoku Application(Python):
    - Description: An abstract strategy board game where players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an                       unbroken line of five stones of their color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

* Snake Application(Python):
    - Description: A console-implementation of the classic Snake game.

* Scramble Application(Python):
    - Description: A console-implementation of the Scramble game. A random sentence is scrambled and the user need to swap letters until he reach the initial form of the sentence.
